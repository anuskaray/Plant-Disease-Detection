# Plant-Disease-Detection
This project is based on finding plant diseases using plant village dataset.


# Problem Statement


Plant diseases are a severe threat to the entire production. Therefore, it is essential for farmers to effectively deal with them and check them with the help of timely prevention. 
Modern technologies come to the aid of farmers. EOS Crop Monitoring allows you to identify dangerous areas and apply an individual approach to yield treatment, 
significantly increasing disease control effectiveness.

# Dataset

we have taken a dataset from Kaggle plant village dataset

THE DATSET consists of 3 classes related to potato health, potato early bright, potato late bright.


# Proposed Methodology

On the yearly basis the agriculture field witnesses’ major reduction in productivity 
performance and crop losses since farmers are unable to identify the disease type 
in the initial stages. The farmer’s naked eye observations of leaves are often not 
capable of identifying the disease type and often need an expert to make 
predictions. 
These losses have a major impact on the production and thus on the lives of 
farmers. The proposed model designed and developed an automated system 
which is used for identification of plant diseases that helps to determine if the 
plant is infected by a disease or not. 
The following are the steps in which the process is carried out: 
1. Acquiring of the plant image dataset different varieties of plant images 
containing 38 different classes of plant diseases. 
2. Pre-processing of the image in different convolutional layers. 
3. Classification of plant diseases stating if the given plant leaf image is diseased or healthy.
